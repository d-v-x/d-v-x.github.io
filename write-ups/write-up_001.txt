<h2>Payload Obfuscation With Double Encoding</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Conventional Cross Site Scripting (XSS) payload normally can be detected and sanitized by most Web Application Firewall (WAF). However, this can be easily bypassed 
with various encoding scheme. For web application, one of the most widely use encoding scheme is url encoding or also knows as percent encoding. In my case, I able to bypass 
the defence against XSS by using double url encoding.

<p style="text-align:justify">
The program I tested enables the user to provide a link/url in their profile, which can be an oppoturnity for an attacker to include XSS payload in the particular field which may 
lead to Stored XSS. However, when <code>javascript:prompt(document.cookie)</code> included within the field, the payload sanitized/changed to '#' character.
